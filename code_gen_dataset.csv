2,Counter 2,"Write a function createCounter. It should accept an initial integer init. It should return an object with three functions.

The three functions are:

increment() increases the current value by 1 and then returns it.
decrement() reduces the current value by 1 and then returns it.
reset() sets the current value to init and then returns it.

The returned array should be created such that returnedArray[i] = fn(arr[i], i).

Please solve it without the built-in Array.map method.","Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3], fn = function plusone(n) { return n + 1; }
Output: [2,3,4]
Explanation:
const newArray = map(arr, plusone); // [2,3,4]
The function increases each value in the array by one. 
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3], fn = function plusI(n, i) { return n + i; }
Output: [1,3,5]
Explanation: The function increases each value by the index it resides in.

4,Filter Elements from Array,"Given an integer array arr and a filtering function fn, return a filtered array filteredArr.

The fn function takes one or two arguments:

arr[i] - number from the arr
i - index of arr[i]
filteredArr should only contain the elements from the arr for which the expression fn(arr[i], i) evaluates to a truthy value. A truthy value is a value where Boolean(value) returns true.

Please solve it without the built-in Array.filter method.","Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,10,20,30], fn = function greaterThan10(n) { return n > 10; }
Output: [20,30]
Explanation:
const newArray = filter(arr, fn); // [20, 30]
The function filters out values that are not greater than 10
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3], fn = function firstIndex(n, i) { return i === 0; }
Output: [1]
Explanation:
fn can also accept the index of each element
In this case, the function removes elements not at index 0
Example 3:

Input: arr = [-2,-1,0,1,2], fn = function plusOne(n) { return n + 1 }

5,Array Reduce Transformation,"Given an integer array nums, a reducer function fn, and an initial value init, return the final result obtained by executing the fn function on each element of the array, sequentially, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element.

This result is achieved through the following operations: val = fn(init, nums[0]), val = fn(val, nums[1]), val = fn(val, nums[2]), ... until every element in the array has been processed. The ultimate value of val is then returned.

If the length of the array is 0, the function should return init.

Please solve it without using the built-in Array.reduce method.

","Example 1:

Input: 
nums = [1,2,3,4]
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return accum + curr; }
init = 0
Output: 10
Explanation:
initially, the value is init=0.
(0) + nums[0] = 1
(1) + nums[1] = 3
(3) + nums[2] = 6
(6) + nums[3] = 10
The final answer is 10.
Example 2:

Input: 
nums = [1,2,3,4]
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return accum + curr * curr; }
init = 100
Output: 130
Explanation:
initially, the value is init=100.
(100) + nums[0] * nums[0] = 101
(101) + nums[1] * nums[1] = 105
(105) + nums[2] * nums[2] = 114
(114) + nums[3] * nums[3] = 130
The final answer is 130.
Example 3:

Input: 
nums = []
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return 0; }
init = 25

6,Promise Time Limit,"Given an asynchronous function fn and a time t in milliseconds, return a new time limited version of the input function. fn takes arguments provided to the time limited function.

The time limited function should follow these rules:

If the fn completes within the time limit of t milliseconds, the time limited function should resolve with the result.
If the execution of the fn exceeds the time limit, the time limited function should reject with the string ""Time Limit Exceeded"".","Example 1:

Input: 
fn = async (n) => { 
  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); 
  return n * n; 
}
inputs = [5]
t = 50
Output: {""rejected"":""Time Limit Exceeded"",""time"":50}
Explanation:
const limited = timeLimit(fn, t)
const start = performance.now()
let result;
try {
   const res = await limited(...inputs)
   result = {""resolved"": res, ""time"": Math.floor(performance.now() - start)};
} catch (err) {
   result = {""rejected"": err, ""time"": Math.floor(performance.now() - start)};
}
console.log(result) // Output

The provided function is set to resolve after 100ms. However, the time limit is set to 50ms. It rejects at t=50ms because the time limit was reached.
Example 2:

Input: 
fn = async (n) => { 
  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); 
  return n * n; 
}
inputs = [5]
t = 150
Output: {""resolved"":25,""time"":100}
Explanation:
The function resolved 5 * 5 = 25 at t=100ms. The time limit is never reached.
Example 3:

Input: 
fn = async (a, b) => { 
  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 120)); 
  return a + b; 
}
inputs = [5,10]
t = 150
Output: {""resolved"":15,""time"":120}
Explanation:
​​​​The function resolved 5 + 10 = 15 at t=120ms. The time limit is never reached.
Example 4:

Input: 
fn = async () => { 
  throw ""Error"";

7,Cache With Time Limit,"Write a class that allows getting and setting key-value pairs, however a time until expiration is associated with each key.

The class has three public methods:

set(key, value, duration): accepts an integer key, an integer value, and a duration in milliseconds. Once the duration has elapsed, the key should be inaccessible. The method should return true if the same un-expired key already exists and false otherwise. Both the value and duration should be overwritten if the key already exists.

get(key): if an un-expired key exists, it should return the associated value. Otherwise it should return -1.

count(): returns the count of un-expired keys.","Example 1:

Input: 
actions = [""TimeLimitedCache"", ""set"", ""get"", ""count"", ""get""]
values = [[], [1, 42, 100], [1], [], [1]]
timeDelays = [0, 0, 50, 50, 150]
Output: [null, false, 42, 1, -1]
Explanation:
At t=0, the cache is constructed.
At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of 100ms. The value doesn't exist so false is returned.
At t=50, key=1 is requested and the value of 42 is returned.
At t=50, count() is called and there is one active key in the cache.
At t=100, key=1 expires.
At t=150, get(1) is called but -1 is returned because the cache is empty.
Example 2:

Input: 
actions = [""TimeLimitedCache"", ""set"", ""set"", ""get"", ""get"", ""get"", ""count""]

timeDelays = [0, 0, 40, 50, 120, 200, 250]
Output: [null, false, true, 50, 50, -1, 0]
Explanation:
At t=0, the cache is constructed.
At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of 50ms. The value doesn't exist so false is returned.
At t=40, a key-value pair (1: 50) is added with a time limit of 100ms. A non-expired value already existed so true is returned and the old value was overwritten.
At t=50, get(1) is called which returned 50.
At t=120, get(1) is called which returned 50.
At t=140, key=1 expires.
At t=200, get(1) is called but the cache is empty so -1 is returned.

8,Debounce,"Given a function fn and a time in milliseconds t, return a debounced version of that function.

A debounced function is a function whose execution is delayed by t milliseconds and whose execution is cancelled if it is called again within that window of time. The debounced function should also receive the passed parameters.

For example, let's say t = 50ms, and the function was called at 30ms, 60ms, and 100ms.

The first 2 function calls would be cancelled, and the 3rd function call would be executed at 150ms.

If instead t = 35ms, The 1st call would be cancelled, the 2nd would be executed at 95ms, and the 3rd would be executed at 135ms.

The above diagram shows how debounce will transform events. Each rectangle represents 100ms and the debounce time is 400ms. Each color represents a different set of inputs.

Please solve it without using lodash's _.debounce() function.
","Example 1:

Input: 
t = 50
calls = [
  {""t"": 50, inputs: [1]},
  {""t"": 75, inputs: [2]}
]
Output: [{""t"": 125, inputs: [2]}]
Explanation:
let start = Date.now();
function log(...inputs) { 
  console.log([Date.now() - start, inputs ])
}
const dlog = debounce(log, 50);
setTimeout(() => dlog(1), 50);
setTimeout(() => dlog(2), 75);

The 1st call is cancelled by the 2nd call because the 2nd call occurred before 100ms
The 2nd call is delayed by 50ms and executed at 125ms. The inputs were (2).
Example 2:

Input: 
t = 20
calls = [
  {""t"": 50, inputs: [1]},
  {""t"": 100, inputs: [2]}
]
Output: [{""t"": 70, inputs: [1]}, {""t"": 120, inputs: [2]}]
Explanation:
The 1st call is delayed until 70ms. The inputs were (1).
The 2nd call is delayed until 120ms. The inputs were (2).
Example 3:

Input: 
t = 150
calls = [
  {""t"": 50, inputs: [1, 2]},
  {""t"": 300, inputs: [3, 4]},
  {""t"": 300, inputs: [5, 6]}
]
Output: [{""t"": 200, inputs: [1,2]}, {""t"": 450, inputs: [5, 6]}]
Explanation:
The 1st call is delayed by 150ms and ran at 200ms. The inputs were (1, 2).
The 2nd call is cancelled by the 3rd call

10,Event Emitter,"Design an EventEmitter class. This interface is similar (but with some differences) to the one found in Node.js or the Event Target interface of the DOM. The EventEmitter should allow for subscribing to events and emitting them.

Your EventEmitter class should have the following two methods:

subscribe - This method takes in two arguments: the name of an event as a string and a callback function. This callback function will later be called when the event is emitted.
An event should be able to have multiple listeners for the same event. When emitting an event with multiple callbacks, each should be called in the order in which they were subscribed. An array of results should be returned. You can assume no callbacks passed to subscribe are referentially identical.
The subscribe method should also return an object with an unsubscribe method that enables the user to unsubscribe. When it is called, the callback should be removed from the list of subscriptions and undefined should be returned.
emit - This method takes in two arguments: the name of an event as a string and an optional array of arguments that will be passed to the callback(s). If there are no callbacks subscribed to the given event, return an empty array. Otherwise, return an array of the results of all callback calls in the order they were subscribed.","Example 1:

emitter.emit(""firstEvent""); // [], no callback are subscribed yet
emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent"", function cb1() { return 5; });
emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent"", function cb2() { return 6; });
emitter.emit(""firstEvent""); // [5, 6], returns the output of cb1 and cb2

values = [[], [""firstEvent"", ""function cb1(...args) { return args.join(','); }""], [""firstEvent"", [1,2,3]], [""firstEvent"", [3,4,6]]]
Output: [[],[""subscribed""],[""emitted"",[""1,2,3""]],[""emitted"",[""3,4,6""]]]
Explanation: Note that the emit method should be able to accept an OPTIONAL array of arguments.

const emitter = new EventEmitter();
emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent, function cb1(...args) { return args.join(','); });
emitter.emit(""firstEvent"", [1, 2, 3]); // [""1,2,3""]

There are only 4 different actions: EventEmitter, emit, subscribe, and unsubscribe.
The EventEmitter action doesn't take any arguments.
The emit action takes between either 1 or 2 arguments. The first argument is the name of the event we want to emit, and the 2nd argument is passed to the callback functions.
The subscribe action takes 2 arguments, where the first one is the event name and the second is the callback function.

It should also allow consecutive operations to be performed using method chaining. The Calculator class constructor should accept a number which serves as the initial value of result.

Your Calculator class should have the following methods:

add - This method adds the given number value to the result and returns the updated Calculator.
subtract - This method subtracts the given number value from the result and returns the updated Calculator.
multiply - This method multiplies the result  by the given number value and returns the updated Calculator.
divide - This method divides the result by the given number value and returns the updated Calculator. If the passed value is 0, an error ""Division by zero is not allowed"" should be thrown.
power - This method raises the result to the power of the given number value and returns the updated Calculator.
getResult - This method returns the result.

21,Dota2 Senate,"In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.

The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise one of the two rights:

Ban one senator's right: A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.
Announce the victory: If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.
Given a string senate representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then if there are n senators, the size of the given string will be n.

The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.

Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party. Predict which party will finally announce the victory and change the Dota2 game. The output should be ""Radiant"" or ""Dire"".","Example 1:

Input: senate = ""RD""
Output: ""Radiant""
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And in round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.
Example 2:

Input: senate = ""RDD""
Output: ""Dire""
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned.

C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.

42,Intersection of Two Linked Lists,"Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:


The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

Custom Judge:

The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):

intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.
listA - The first linked list.
listB - The second linked list.
skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.","Example 1:


Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.
Example 2:


Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
Example 3:


Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.","/**
