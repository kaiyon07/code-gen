You are given the following JavaScript function:
```
{function}
```

Write at least 10 tests for this function in the following JSON format. Do not include any comments in your JSON. Each test should be formulated as a string invoking the function, which, upon `eval()`, will return the output of the function. Note that this format means you do not have to include expected outputs, only inputs.
```
{
  "functionOrClassName": "string",
  "tests": [
    "invocation1",
    "invocation2"
  ]
}
```

As an example, if your function was "addTwoNumbers", two of the tests could be "addTwoNumbers(5, 3)" or "addTwoNumbers(Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER, -1)". If the test case requires multiple statements to set up, invoke a lambda function with a return statement, e.g., "(() => {let a = addTwoNumbers(5, 3); return addTwoNumbers(a, 2);})()".
